# Multi-threaded-Client-Server-Application

Created a rudimentary chatting application as part of CS-370 Operating System's assessment. The application was to practice socket programming, threads, and synchronization and runs on a client/server model. It works by creating an instance of the server which hosts multiple clients and enables them to chat with each other using the server as an intermediary.
